  Before graduation, I had experience working with my school to develop the backend of the app service.
  <br/>Since then, I have been in charge of the backend position and developed API server based of that Node.JS(Express.js) and Golang(Gin) using web framework.
  <br/>Through experiencing projects that provide services in real time, I got into concurrency programming also huge traffic handling.
